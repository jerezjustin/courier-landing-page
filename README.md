# Courier-Webpage

![Landing Page Screenshot](/img/screenshot.jpeg)

This is a small but beautifully designed landing page. This was created as a personal project when I was starting web development a few years ago. It was built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- SCSS
- Javascript

# How to install in your local machine

- First, you will need to clone this repository using the following command `git clone https://github.com/jerezjustin/courier-landing-page.git`.
- After that open the project using the editor of your choice and install the dependencies using the command `npm install`, this will install node-sass which is the only dependency for this project.
- Finally you can listen to the changes of the styles running `npm run compile:sass` this will compile the SCSS files into a `style.css` file.
- Open the index.html file in your browser of choice and there you can see the landing page.

> **Warning**
> To successfully compile the scss files into css, you'll need to hit save in one of the files inside the `sass` folder.
